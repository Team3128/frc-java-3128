#Aluminum Narwhals Java Code

This codebase is divided into three sections:
A hardware library, which uses both WPILib classes and homegrown classes in concert to control more complicated assemblies,
the Listener Manager, which runs during teleop and translates buttons and joysticks to lambda and function calls, 
and the autonomous library, which uses WPILib commands and the hardware library to control the robot at a higher level
